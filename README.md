Through 1-on-1 matches, compare the performance of the two behavior control methods mentioned above. Select the better-performing one and further optimize it using evolutionary computation methods;

Based on the results obtained in Part 3, apply swarm intelligence techniques to realize a 3-on-3 soccer match.
